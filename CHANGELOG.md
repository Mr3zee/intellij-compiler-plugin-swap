# Kotlin External FIR Support Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.14] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Android Studio version 262.9437.185 support

## [0.3.13] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Custom plugin bundles linked only to bundled default repositories now preserve those repository links across settings persistence round trips.
- IntelliJ 262 builds now target the current non-expired 262 EAP platform.

## [0.3.12] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Android Studio version 261.26222.65 support

## [0.3.11] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- File watcher no longer reports an unhandled exception when the OS runs out of inotify instances / open files (Linux); watching is disabled gracefully instead. State clears (Refresh/Clear Caches, external changes) now fully reset the watch service, letting it recover after a transient OS failure. Also fixed a race that could leak a watch service (inotify instance) during concurrent registration.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Android Studio version 261.25134.95 support

## [0.3.9] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Issue with a self-update detection that entered an infinite loop of clearing the state.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Android Studio version 261.24374.151 support

## [0.3.7] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- IntelliJ 262 support

## [0.3.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Android Studio version 261.23567.138 support

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Android Studio version 261.22158.277 support

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Android Studio Kotlin version support: detect Android Studio stub Kotlin versions (e.g. `2.2.255-dev-255`) and resolve them to actual Kotlin versions using a bundled mapping from IntelliJ platform build numbers
- Android Studio `runIde` build support via `runAndroidStudio` Gradle task
- GitHub workflow to check Android Studio version mapping freshness daily

### Fixed

- Fix "not found" message in jar locator

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- Fix infinite loop on Windows where file watcher ENTRY_DELETE events during jar downloads triggered `clearState()`, cancelling the running locator and restarting it indefinitely
- Fix orphaned `.downloading` temp files not being cleaned up when the locator coroutine is cancelled
- Fix downloaded JAR files not being verified against their expected MD5 checksum, allowing corrupted transfers to be silently cached
- Fix `moved()` rename failure for a single artifact (e.g., Windows file lock) aborting the entire bundle instead of falling through gracefully

### Added

- SNAPSHOT version support: requested `-SNAPSHOT` versions now resolve against timestamped versions in Maven repositories, with automatic version-level metadata resolution for download filenames

### Changed

- File watcher self-update suppression now uses a 2-second grace period after `markSelfUpdateEnd()` to absorb delayed OS event delivery

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- Fix replacement version patterns escaping regex metacharacters (e.g., `.` and `+` in version templates)
- Fix lifecycle cache returning wrong JAR when the same plugin is requested with different versions
- Fix watcher initialization order so local repository watchers work regardless of registration order at startup
- Fix cache rediscovery for artifacts using replacement version patterns
- Fix downloads from servers that omit `Content-Length` header (chunked/proxied responses)
- Fix watch key leaks causing OS file handle exhaustion on deregister/cleanup
- Fix `AtomicMoveNotSupportedException` with fallback to non-atomic move and `REPLACE_EXISTING`
- Fix exception report file creation (inverted existence check)
- Fix disk scanner crash on checksum computation I/O errors
- Fix cross-platform path handling in file watcher and provider (use `invariantSeparatorsPathString`)
- Fix service lookup in exception reporter

### Changed

- Plugin now requires IDE restart on install/update
- Refactor `KefsJarAnalyzer` to use `ZipInputStream` instead of `JarFile`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Fix removing plugins from the settings page

### Changed

- Make until build range open for the latest IDE version

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Support for IDE versions 251, 252, 253, and 261
- `KEFS: Copy Kotlin IDE Version` action — copies the IDE's internal Kotlin compiler version to the clipboard
- `KEFS: Toggle Extended Debounce` troubleshooting action — extends the cache invalidation debounce interval to work around analysis re-trigger issues

### Changed

- Improved file watching: monitors local repository directory trees recursively, automatically detecting new subdirectories and artifacts
- Cache directory file watching now suppresses notifications during plugin self-updates, reducing unnecessary re-actualization
- Renamed local disk cache directory from `$USER_HOME/.kotlinPlugins` to `$USER_HOME/.kefs`
- Renamed action prefix from `Kotlin FIR External Support:` to `KEFS:`
- Renamed settings page from `Tools > Kotlin Plugins` to `Tools > Kotlin External FIR Support`
- Renamed diagnostics tool window from `Kotlin Plugins Diagnostics` to `KEFS Diagnostics`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Onboarding guide: https://github.com/Mr3zee/kotlin-external-fir-support/blob/main/GUIDE.md
- For compiler plugin developers guide: https://github.com/Mr3zee/kotlin-external-fir-support/blob/main/PLUGIN_AUTHORS.md
- **Plugin Replacement Engine:** Added the core mechanism to intercept Kotlin compiler plugin requests within the
  IDE. This allows KEFS to replace a project's plugin version (e.g. built for Kotlin `2.2.20`) with a
  version compatible with the IDE's internal compiler (e.g., `2.2.0-ij251-78`).
- **Plugin Bundles:** Added support for "bundles", which group multiple artifacts (e.g., `cli`, `k2`,
  `backend`, `common`) to be treated as a single compiler plugin.
- **Version Resolution Strategies:** Implemented three strategies for finding compatible plugin
  versions:
    * **Exact:** The library version must be identical to the one requested.
    * **Same Major:** Finds the latest version with the same major version number.
    * **Latest:** Finds the latest available version of the plugin.
- **Maven Repository Support:** Added support for configuring Maven repositories on a per-plugin
  basis. Two types of repositories are supported:
    * **Remote:** A repository specified by a URL.
    * **Local:** A local directory on the file system structured as a Maven repository.
- **Background Processing & Caching:** All plugin resolution, network access, and indexing now run in the
  background to ensure the UI and analysis remain responsive.
- **Local Disk Cache:** Resolved plugins are now cached locally in `$USER_HOME/.kotlinPlugins` to provide
  fast, on-demand access without repeated downloads.
- **Periodic Updates:** Implemented a background "Actualization" job that runs every 2 minutes to check for
  new versions of plugins.
- **Checksum Verification:** KEFS now calculates and compares MD5 checksums to avoid re-downloading jars
  that are already present and are up to date.
- **File Watching & Hot-Reload:** Added file watchers for all cached jars. For
  local repositories, KEFS uses symlinks to watch the original file, enabling automatic hot-reloading of a plugin in the
  IDE when it's re-published locally.
- **Project-Level Configuration:** All plugin and repository settings are now stored in the project's
  `.idea/kotlin-plugins.xml` file.
- **User Actions:** Added three new actions available from the "Find Action" (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+A)
  menu:
    * `Kotlin FIR External Support: Update Plugins`
    * `Kotlin FIR External Support: Refresh Plugins`
    * `Kotlin FIR External Support: Clear Caches`
- **Project Sync Hook:** KEFS now hooks into project reloads (like a Gradle sync) to clear its state and
  adapt to configuration changes.
- **Runtime Exception Tracking:** Added a new feature to analyze all exceptions reported to the IDE's root
  logger.
- **Fault Detection:** KEFS analyzes the class FQ names of all loaded plugin jars.
  If an exception's stack trace matches a class from a known plugin, KEFS identifies that plugin as the source of the
  failure.
- **Editor Banner Notification:** When a plugin throws an exception, a banner now appears at the top of the
  editor. This banner allows you to:
    * **Disable the plugin:** Immediately stops the failing plugin and restores IDE analysis.
    * **Auto-disable:** Enable a setting to automatically disable any plugin that throws an exception.
    * **Open diagnostics:** Jump to the new diagnostics tool window.
- **Auto-Disable:** Added an "Automatically disable throwing plugins" setting. When enabled, KEFS will
  disable failing plugins and show a balloon notification.
- **Global Toggle:** Exception Analysis can be enabled or disabled in the workspace
  settings.
- **"Kotlin Plugins Diagnostics" Tool Window:** Added a new tool window to provide a complete real-time
  overview of all configured compiler plugins and their artifacts.
- **Status & Error Reporting:** The diagnostics window shows the runtime status for all plugin
  versions:
    * **Success:** Plugin loaded successfully.
    * **Partial Success:** Some artifacts in a bundle loaded, but not all.
    * **Failed To Fetch / Not Found:** Shows detailed error messages if a plugin could not be
      resolved.
    * **Exception in runtime:** Shows a detailed report for any plugin that failed during
      execution.
    * **Skipped:** The plugin has not been requested by the project yet.
    * **Disabled:** The user disabled the plugin.
- **Exception & Jar Inspection:** The diagnostics panel can display the full list of analyzed classes in a
  jar.
- **Settings Page:** Added a new settings page under `Tools > Kotlin Plugins`.
    * **General Tab:** Toggle the Exception Analyzer and auto-disable feature.
    * **Artifacts Tab:** Manage all Maven repositories and Kotlin plugin configurations.
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Added a confirmation dialog for the "Clear Caches" action.
